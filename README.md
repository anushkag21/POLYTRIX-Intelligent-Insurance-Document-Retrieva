# POLYTRIX – Intelligent Insurance Document Retrieval & Q&A🤖📄

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Intelligent Document Question Answering

An end-to-end **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that converts complex insurance policy documents into a searchable knowledge base and uses semantic retrieval + Large Language Models (LLMs) to answer natural-language questions accurately from the source document.

The project was developed to solve a practical problem: **insurance policy documents are long, unstructured, and difficult to search manually.** Instead of relying on keyword-based search, the system retrieves semantically relevant sections of the document and provides concise answers grounded in the retrieved information.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Insurance policy documents contain hundreds of clauses, exclusions, conditions, coverage limits, and claim requirements.

Finding a specific answer such as:

* Who is eligible for coverage?
* What are the base covers?
* What documents are required for a claim?
* What is the entry age limit?
* What happens in case of baggage loss?
* What are the conditions for trip cancellation?

can require manually searching through lengthy documents.

### Objective

Build an AI-powered question-answering pipeline that can:

1. Accept an insurance policy document.
2. Extract structured text from the document.
3. Split the document into meaningful chunks.
4. Create a semantic vector index.
5. Retrieve the most relevant information for a user question.
6. Generate a concise answer using an LLM.
7. Return the answer through an API.

              Grounded Answer
```

The key idea is that the LLM does **not need to process the entire document for every question**.

Instead, the system first retrieves the most relevant document sections and then passes those sections to the LLM as context.

---

## 🔬 Data & NLP Pipeline

### 1. Document Extraction

The system uses **LlamaParse** to extract text from PDF documents and convert the content into a structured Markdown representation.

This allows the pipeline to work with lengthy and complex documents while preserving useful document structure.

### 2. Text Chunking

Large documents cannot efficiently be passed directly to an LLM.

The extracted document is therefore divided into smaller overlapping chunks using **Chonkie**.

The chunking strategy uses:

* Sentence-aware chunking
* Configurable chunk size
* Chunk overlap
* Context refinement

This helps preserve context across chunk boundaries.

### 3. Semantic Search

Instead of matching exact keywords, the system uses **semantic retrieval**.

Document chunks are indexed in **Pinecone**, allowing the system to retrieve passages that are semantically related to the user's question.

For example:

```text
Question:
"What documents are needed for hospitalization claims?"

                    ↓

Semantic Search

                    ↓

Relevant policy sections

                    ↓

LLM Context

                    ↓

Final Answer
```

### 4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation

The retrieved document sections are inserted into a structured prompt and passed to the LLM.

The generation process is designed to:

* Answer directly
* Use information from retrieved sources
* Avoid unnecessary information
* State clearly when information is unavailable
* Keep responses concise

This reduces the risk of the LLM generating information that is unrelated to the policy document.

---

## 🤖 LLM Integration

The project integrates **Groq's LLM API** for answer generation.

The current implementation uses:

```text
moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct
```

The LLM receives:

```text
User Question
      +
Retrieved Document Context
      ↓
   LLM Prompt
      ↓
Grounded Answer
```

The system is therefore based on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation rather than standalone LLM prompting**.

---

## 🔎 Example

### Question

> What is the entry age limit for insured members?

### Retrieved Answer

> The entry age limit for insured members is **3 months to 90 years (completed age)**.

Another example:

### Question

> What documents are required to file a hospitalization claim?

The system retrieves the relevant policy sections and generates a structured response containing items such as:

* Claim form
* Travel ticket / boarding pass
* Medical reports
* Discharge summary
* Hospital bills and receipts
* Medical prescriptions
* FIR / MLC report where applicable

The answer is generated from the retrieved policy content rather than from general internet knowledge.

The project exposes a REST API for document question answering.

### Endpoint

```text
POST /hackrx/run
```

### Input

```json
{
  "documents": "document_url",
  "questions": [
    "What are the base covers?",
    "What is the entry age limit?"
  ]
}
```
